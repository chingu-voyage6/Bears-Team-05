      <p>Doge uses two-word phrases in which the first word is almost always
        one of five modifiers (`so`, `such`, `many`, `much`, and `very`), and
        the departure from correct English is to use the modifier with a word
        that it cannot properly modify. For example, `Much respect. So noble.`
